# prime_minus_bin_rev
This R function Computes the integer sequence "nth prime minus its binary reversal". This is a very cool looking integer sequence when plotted, and can is featured in the Numberphile youtube video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAMgUB51XZA. The integer sequence is documented at the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as A265326: https://oeis.org/A265326. 

# Here's what the plot looks like:
